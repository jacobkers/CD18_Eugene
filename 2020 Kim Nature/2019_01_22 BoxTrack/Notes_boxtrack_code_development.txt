-adapted file names and inits so that MukBEF kymographs can be loaded; should be backward compatible.
-see also çondensin with plectonemes' notes
-to save 'boxtrack'' and CondPlec' code to the same output directory, add code labels:
	prefix 'EKMcp_A020' means generated by Eugene Kim Matlab CondensinwPlectoneme code, prog A020
	prefix 'EKMbt' boxtrack etc.

4-9
	-from here on, these notes refer specifically to the 'boxtrack' code
	-set up option for data&code on shared (to be updated via or to github)


3-9
	-github: re-organized code
	-Boxtrack: running/clicking both datasets

2-9
	-boxtracker: better description of intensity measurement
	-storing a 'regular loop' vs. 'Zloop' measurement

24-7 
	-build separate tools
	-improve peak detection
	-Boxtrack: changed box content analysis: 

	
6-3  Githubbed
	A002 Shell: Clickit and Box  use now same inits, can be run separately and together


5-3 githubbed
	-boxtracker: allows now pre-start-t no-motion analysis to 	get zero intensities
	-added kymo-analysis code
	-started building shell

19-2
	-added pre-t to settings

6-2 sent to github
   -small patch in boxtracker

	A005: 
   -added original kymograph generator (MvL and others)
	A030 just added to be sure

28-1 
	A030:
	-included 'left', 'middle' (=stem&hat) 'right'
	-added checksum that should be 100%

27-1 send to Github &EK
	A30: Expanding boxtracker to Fig2 panels;
	added width, I_left, I_right
	A28: separate click tool

25-1
A30: Boxtracker now works for any number of loops

23-1 A30
'Box tracker' code, follows two traces sparately

12-12 A20
	-added 'loopinfo.components' to store loop structure for later
	-refined loop, residu, content contributions; 
	-checked all adds to 100%
	-ensured fields have correct lengths

11-12 A20 sent to Github
	-condensin-analysis: organized output structure
     -condensin-analysis: added link to loop via 	distancelabels
	-condensin-analysis: building histograms by category
	-loop-analysis: tightened loop edges to inner peaks
      -loop-analysis: save better 'mushroom section' intensity

5-12 ; A20: sent to github
	-refined loop edge detection 
	(same as tether edge detection)
	-more output 'loopinfo': 
	left, middle  right, leftonly, rightonly
	-cosmetics
	-added evenmore molecules dataset
	-improved low-loop analysis
	-section division based on loop components 
	  varies too much, changed to simple edges
	-added loop to do all exps in one run

27-11
	-expand action options

A020_KymoStackTrack
-added: kymocleaning: flatten whole kymograph left-right, plus simple bleach correction
-added: per profile: refined tether left and right: first flatten background on left and right minimum, otherwise some tethers turn out to long.
-tested on 2 'pilot run' sets


27-11 sent github. 
A020_KymoStackTrack
-added treshold-based tether start and stop to data; 
 added this to plot panel
-split analysis and plot loops for better structure
-some cosmetics

25-9 sent to github
A020_KymoStackTrack main
-improved loop level detection
-add left/loop/right content data
minor
-changed result plot layout
-added some tools

	A020_KymoStackTrack: set up 'More molecules'  test dat	
	-reorganized labels for larger datasets
	-simplified: silence cluster analysis, since we 
		are only using the spots of the peeling method....
	-automatically checks if condensin data is present


5-9
A020_KymoStackTrack after discussion with EK
-tried edges loop on cumulative function, fails. back to tresholding fixed-level
-added 3-pts subpixel peakpeeling



5-9 sent to Github
A020_KymoStackTrack: completed analysis line inc. savings, DNA loop properties. To be refined, works


3-9
made analysis multi-exp run (now 'Roi'and 'Roi3')
split loop from DNA; simplify via cluster analysis
small patches

to do now: 
fill in: loopinfo=Analyze_Loop(loop_kymo,residu_kymo);
	-treshold above DNA, 
	-then build clusters, get length etc.

28-8 sent to Github
	-added subpixel localization to multi-peak fitter



27-8 sent to GitHub
-set up multi-peak fitting on kymographs
-made analysis bi-channel (condensin and DNA)
-option to load imageJ-kymograph or make one from images
-save all ploted data to mat file
-allow multi-exp analysis
-re-named some code
