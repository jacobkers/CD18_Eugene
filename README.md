# BN_CD18_EK_CondensinTrack

Matlab code to analyze condensin data

This software was custom written for data analysis associated with 
“DNA-loop extruding condensin complexes can traverse one another” by Kim et al, accepted to Nature ; 2019  

Interested users are expected to be comfortable with MATLAB programming and able to understand code and adjust independently for own use. 
Likewise, a basic understanding of image and signal analysis is expected. 
While care was taken in testing, since this non-commercial code is intended for lab use,  
we cannot guarantee it is fully bug free. Responsibility for re-use and re-editing on alternate datasets resides with the user.
