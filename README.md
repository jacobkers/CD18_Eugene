Cees Dekker Lab

## description
This repository contains my custom code associated with publications from the Cees Dekker lab I was involved in.
Interested users can freely use (parts of) the code. In such case, please cite the associated papers. 
Regarding specific questions, please send these via the corresponding authors.

## disclaimer:
It is understood these are custom developed code snippets to elucidate the data processing  of the associated papers.
Code is not designed for general use and minor bugs may still be present. Interested users are expected to have a proper understanding of the code language.

For some work, an earlier repository may exist that was referenced in the publication. This is noted in the corresponding README.
