spots00_harvest_all_ROIs: 
	roi was frame index, corrected
	save now also properties per ROI, for now kymosize and roiname
A040 now replots per kymograph from stored data




28-4 
re-organized classification of spots
added A040: select and save depending on plec-Cnd association
note: initval.channelshift is used in ''spots00_harvest_all_ROIs'' to shift the condensin position



20-4 sent to Github
-Reviving local paths to test run main
-Added ''user'' options and files so we can keep local config files
-A020 
	kym_get_length_and_densities: 
	-adding curvestart, curvestop, curve ok to properties of info_DNA
	-adding a flag 'not near edge' 
-A030
	-collect new fields
....to do: build classification fields


14-1 sent to Github
-A20, line 54: added an optional kymograph save back to input data, to be able to use 'boxtrack' on this kymograph
-to save 'boxtrack'' and CondPlec' code to the same output directory, add code labels:
	prefix 'EKMcp_A020' means generated by Eugene Kim Matlab CondensinwPlectoneme code, prog A020
	prefix 'EKMbt' boxtrack etc.
works


13-1-2020 added to Github
-some missing files on Github, synced things
-build shared TEST directory on M, minimal data sets
-test running A000_main; ok
-re-sorting A002: every experiment is now collected in one function
-to add: option Mukbef/condensin naming
-added MukBEF ROI 1-2 test, works



4-9 
	-reorganized codeA000 --A030 for better readability and preparing new analysis
	-made a new A0001 shell program
    -annotated subfunctions
    -added the experiment '2019_09_02 NumberOfCondensinPerDNA' and did following:
"Condensin density per DNA length was estimated as follows. First, movie frames were mapped into  intensity profiles along the tether length by subpixel interpolation mapping. This was done for both the DNA signal channel, as the condensin signal channel. Next, these profiles were collected in intensity vs. position-time kymographs. To measure the length of the DNA tether, we took the median of the DNA signal kymograph to get an average DNA profile; from this profile, we measured the profile edges to get a representative DNA length. 
Condensin was counted by simple peak detection on the condensin profiles associated with each time point of the condensin kymograph. To suppress noise, the profiles were smoothed and only peaks above a certain treshold were counted. This treshold was taken as two times the standard deviation of the background noise.
Next, we obtained the density of condensin per DNA lenght by summing the total number of detected condensins over all time points, and divided this by the total observed DNA length; the latter simply being the tether length multiplied by the observation time. To avoid biasing by surface effects, we excluded DNA tether length and condensin counts that were within 
~400 nanometer of the tether attachment points. Thus, we obtained an average condensin density per tether. Finally, we repeated this measurement for ten separate tethers to find an average plus eor for the condensin density. "
