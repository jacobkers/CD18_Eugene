Drift Correct :
 
-First run the A010FindDriftvector file.
1. It will open the brightfield images of cells (change the imagepath : line10: initval.imagepath= XXX).
2. Select 5 cells by a left mouse clicking on their centers.
3. It will calculate the drift vector between various timepoints and save the file as a text file into the same folder.
 
-Run the A020CorrectDrift file.
1. It will create a folder with drift corrected files.

-Initialize A030_Dipistart.

-Run A040_Cellidentifier_LociData
1. In order to select if the loci belongs to a single cell, left mouse click on the cell body and then right click to move to the next one.
2. The data will be saved into a new folder in a matfile format.

-Run A050_Cellcropper_Loci.
1. Run the file to crop the selected files from the A040_Cellidentifier step. It will create time-lapse stacks with single cells with single channels

-march 2021:
A060_LociiDynamics: only shows images
A060_LociiTracing: loads images and tracks spots, no correction for cell drift; finds moive average location of single spot and then tracks variations in that box per image
A065_LociiTraceDynamics: creates msd traces
