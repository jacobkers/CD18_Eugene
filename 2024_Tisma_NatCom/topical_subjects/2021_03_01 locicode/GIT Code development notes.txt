12-5  up to A70
-copied all subdirs to blue-o for local work
-A60: added raw trace save in .mat
-A65: use to check quickly what was done
-A70: save a mosaic of all channels, first and last frame for referral
-A50: cropping edge check added, now works
-note: multispot??


10-5 run remote bulk via office pc: 
A20 to A65, data 2.1--2.5 (drift clicked earlier)
crash on 2.2?

10-5 locii, A60: 
-show traces per cell, save for viewing
-use soft-edges mask blur from BF
-experimenting with different trackers per channel
-subtract pos color 1(=chrom) from 2, 3


3-5 Locii tracking
back to blue-O: works
set up remote: laptop VPN; slow!
work via office pc
2.2 cell 60: check for empty centroid pos
2.1,2.2 work
started on A060, rewriting load format
A60 runs complete on 2.1 local
A65 runs complete
--> Runshell back to live


21-4 batch preps
A05: clicking split off from drift correction

21-4 running 2.1...2.5 bulk via office up to A050; works

pushed
21-4 loci code: add chromosome tracking
-organize 'tools'
-A040/50: add shortset frame option
-A050: allow for less c channels
-runs but not all colors...
config, A40/50: removed references to rfp and cfp, now color 1, 2, 3 (can be empty)
A050: changed saving to tiff stacks for handling less files
A060 dynamics just for showing --> A070
A060_tracking: to be worked on

19-4 loci code revival II
-A001 Set up runshell
-A000 organize remote data: L:\tnw\BN\CD\Shared\Timo Muller\2019.12.5 - 2179 room temp
-A010 drift correction log scale for better visibility; run it (NB very slow via laptop-remote bulk- might separate clicking from carrying out. copy local for now)
-A20 under runshell works


16-3-2021 revisit loci code
Set up this document to compare this package with original FW code
functions in '2021_03_15 chrdiffisivity':
msdplot.m: combines lociidata and cell data to get msd's
func_chrfinderc.m
func_locifinder.m

-march 2021 checkup:
A010-20-30 standard preps
A040:identifies cells via phase images, links foci images to cells
A050:crops all channels via cell area measurements
A060_LociiDynamics: only shows images
A060_LociiTracing: loads images and tracks spots, no correction for cell drift; finds moive average location of single spot and then tracks variations in that box per image
A065_LociiTraceDynamics: creates msd traces

note that chromosome channel is not cropped or used
