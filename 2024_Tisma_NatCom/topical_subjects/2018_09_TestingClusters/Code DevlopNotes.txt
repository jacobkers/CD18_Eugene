Current state, paper 2018, rebuttal 2, Fig S9 V06: all works
Top program is A000_ClusterTestShell. This runs a simulator and the analyzer: get_clusters as a 	loop using various input parameters. Alternative is first to generate and save, do external deconvolution and re-load these files. Then, 'sim'settings should match the settings stored in the filenames

Main functions, some run independently:
	-TCl_201809_load_cluster_testpattern
	-TCl_201809_build_cluster_testpattern
	-TCl_201809_get_clusters

The results is summarized by 
	-TCl_201809_process_noiseplotter


23-2 GHd rebuttal 2
	lots of changes

TCl_201809_build_cluster_testpattern: expanded testing shell with more elaborate sims; setup repeats

16-1-2019
: expand cluster testing

9-10 Renamed all specific functions (added TCl_201809_) to keep them part of devlop project only
