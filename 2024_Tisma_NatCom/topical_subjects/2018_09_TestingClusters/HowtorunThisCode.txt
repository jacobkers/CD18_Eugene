Evaluation test of cluster anallysis; Jacob Kerssemakers, feb 2019. 

Top program is A000_ClusterTestShell
This runs a simulator and the analyzer: get_clusters as a loop using various input parameters. Alternative is first to generate and save, do external deconvolution and re-load these files. Then, 'sim'settings should match the settings stored in the filenames

Main functions, some run independently:
	-TCl_201809_load_cluster_testpattern
	-TCl_201809_build_cluster_testpattern
	-TCl_201809_get_clusters

The results is summarized by TCl_201809_process_noiseplotter


Criterion is number clusters in-clusters/out
