fixed-roi tracker

steps: 
-In ImageJ, 
	make a particle image (typically a MAX or AV)
	make a background image (MIN or supersmoothened)
-in Matlab
	set paths in config
	check various settings in tracker
	run in alphabetical order

#analysis
-----------------------------
code in: analysis\CD20_Cells\topical_projects
data in: M:\tnw\bn\cd\Shared\Tisma\Bacillus subtilis chromosome imaging\Widefield_and_deconvolution	\20230428_BSG4595_dynamics
file organization: see data description in: A000_ConfigExp.m

data names, taken at specified intervals:
BSG4595_1s_001
BSG4595_1s_002
BSG4595_1s_004
BSG4595_10s_001_series1_perframe
BSG4595_10s_001_series2_perframe
BSG4595_30s_001_series1_perframe
BSG4595_30s_001_series2_perframe

rationale for settings:
spots are about 7 pixels FWHM
cells are round and about 27 pixels in diameter

after some trying:
--> pre-smooth first image:
1) at 1 pixels to suppress noise 
2) at 100 pixels for background

spot detection settings:
edge=20; %spots closer to edge than this will not be analyzed
backsquaregridsize=50; %used in background image determination
particletreshold=2.5; %number of sigmas a local maximum needs to stick out 
minproximity=10; %when spots are closer together than this, only the brightest one is kept

%further selection:
-we have bright 'marker spots' that lose much less their intensity than the ori spots
