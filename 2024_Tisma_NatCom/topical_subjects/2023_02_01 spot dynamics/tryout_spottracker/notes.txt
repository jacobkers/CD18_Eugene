this dir contains a tryout to use SpotTracker from ImageJ
In the end, it was a lot of work for a few trace so I went to the custom Matlab approach

work notes
----------------------------
ori data: M:\tnw\bn\cd\Shared\Tisma\Bacillus subtilis chromosome imaging\Widefield_and_deconvolution\20230428_BSG4595_dynamics

ImageJ 
pre-cook spot movies:
open ori stack, 
duplicate: gaussian blur 15pts
then ori div blur to suppress bleaching effect
blur result gauss 1.5 to suppress noise.
saved in: CD20_Cells\topical_projects\2023_02_01 spot dynamics
Result of BSG4595_1s_001.tiff

selection steps:
window under roi manager
1) check with SpotTracker if it follows within a roi
2) if so, add to rois
3) save rois for later use:
	- in original format
	- via 'list' as csv
4) track:
	open movie and pre-cook
	re-open rois, 
	perform tracking with SpotTracker per roi, save
5) duplicate crops if wished for illustration
6) drift correction in post-processing (pick also some 'marker cells')
7) run 'spot_dynamics.m'


data: 
BSG4595_1s_001-4 BF/ori (1s intervals)
BSG4595_10s_001.nd2 - BSG4595_10s_001.nd2 (series 1+2) BF/ori (10s intervals)
BSG4595_30s_001.nd2 - BSG4595_30s_001.nd2 (series 1)
BF is single frame

to do/done:
app. 10 ori spots, 5 'markers' per movie
