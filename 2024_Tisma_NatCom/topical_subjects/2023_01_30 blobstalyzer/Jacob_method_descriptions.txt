Four images were collected. Each of these were intensity tresholded to detect ROIs with separated DNA patterns. Next, a randomly picked ROI was presented to a user for classification of this pattern. The user could choose from one of four categories without knowing from which image the ROI was taken. This was done for a series of 100 picks each, with no ROIs being presented to the user more than once within this series. To obtain an estimate for sampling variation, this series was then repeated 20 times per user. To evaluate possible user bias, the procedure was done independently by two users.
