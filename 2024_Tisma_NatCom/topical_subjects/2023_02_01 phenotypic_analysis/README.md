## disclaimer
This code was custom written and shared to illustrate used algorithms, analysis pathways etc. in relation to published results. The code was regularly used and tested. However, small bugs, not relevant for the data analysis as present in publications may still be around. Interested users are expected to have a sufficient knowledge of Matlab code to understand and adapt the code to their own wishes.
