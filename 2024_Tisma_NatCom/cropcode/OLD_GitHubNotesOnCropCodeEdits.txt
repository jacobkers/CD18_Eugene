-Cropcode: 
-add to github to ensure sync
-made separate 'user_files'
-added user choice to top of shell
-runs okay for Jacob-test
	
18-12
-Removed experiments, limit code to test set, save with local code
-X030: cleaned up; now it always builds five channels; if less color channels are defined, it just duplicates.

9-7
-made function ReadRenameSaveFiles to rename incompatibly named datasets
(here, in ....2016_Sandro\2019_04_07 Paper19_ExampleData\OriNames)
-added  pathinfo.limitzplanes to account for single-palne z-stacks;
-changed lines accordingly: X030_cellcrop4snapshots (line 73)

Aim: build extra channel option
Data:data in: N:\tnw\BN\CD\Shared\My Nguyen\AB1157\2820\2018-07-03-2820-DAPI\2018-07-03-2820-DAPI-1\X040_measurement
	c1 - brf focal plane z ~3
	c2 - DAPI (chromosome) focal plane z ~2
	c3 - rfp (ori)   focal plane z ~3
	c4 - cfp (ter)  focal plane z ~2
	c5 - yfp (MukB) focal plane z ~2
Code changes:
	-X000_setpath4snapshots: line 119
	-X020 extra comments line 165;
	-X020 line 200: readable column names for data-savin
	-MAJOR X030 : renamed output to channels they came from 
	(means repli-and donut code will need some updating too)
		% OLD               NEW
    		% cellc1: cfp-ter   ph/bf
    		% cellc2: yfp-chro  same
    		% cellc3: rfp-ori   same
    		% cellc4: ph/bf     cfp-ter
    		% cellc5: extra     ..._mukbef (optional)
		Thus,  c1 and c4 are effectively swapped!
	

	X000_setpath4snapshots: to retain backward compatibility, 
	added field 'pathinfo.newchannelnaming': 
	pathinfo now saved to X020_cellcoordinate/alldata
	so if this field exists, repli&donut code can swap channels
	
	-X030 added optional channel 5
	-X040, X050 changed channel naming accordingly
	-X050 added plot option: 5-channel works

adapt naming options

Rebuttal 2 work: X030,X050: 
-build small add-on functions in 
	X030-line 82, 123 'savefullstack' via function 'JK_addon_loadfullstack'
	X050- same to pass full stacks wo affecting base code 
-works, applied on dataset: '2016_11_23_2179_Wildtype_Zcheck' (case 7); then deactivated to have code back to default use.



28-5 ent to Github
-X000: added general crop parameter; added label to directory which part of code uses it (X020 etc.)
-X010: removed directory creation to the relevant 'X0...' 
Tested via shell; works



3-4 sent to Github
-X010: auto-making making of directories for results: 
setting up better code test protocol:
-X000_setpath4snapshots, line 17: option limited cell-number 
-X0000_AutoDataTestShell: test shell with auto running all other progs (X10 to X050) on all data in limited cell mode; with intermediate plotting off
-cosmetics here and there

test worked for: 
D:\jkerssemakers\_Data\CD\2016_Sandro\2179-18-10-2017_cropB3\measurement
D:\jkerssemakers\_Data\CD\2016_Sandro\Crop2179-initiations_B2-1\measurement

Get_TimePlaceIndicesFromName
	added 'not found' option
	test on: 'matPtestdata' (no time 't' in name)
X000_setpath4snapshots
	added some clarification to colour number
	line 47 slaved colour number to Z-plane array per case
	took over version from Sandro; works



7-3
Version refresh github, make sure it is in sync with local



21-2 sent to github
X020, X030 building more flexible name recognition (errs now)
if number of color channels is lower than 4 , 'ter'is duplicated from ori
X040,X050 no crash, but seem to not find valid ori spots in testdata??
solved



5-12 sent to github
made X050 working (saves for donut code)

5-12 sent to github
X020/cellprescreening_fb added autorun option (passing all cells and frames
X030/40 cells are counted per time frame, cell nr 1 is mostly the same for all images so this links easily
X040 changed find name template to fit to X030 name format
X030 added time&position string to filename
X000 changed coodinatedirsave



4-12
X020 makes now no distinction between different positions or different frames;
if more frames detected, it uses frame&pos-naming
X020 code path returns
X000 polished  for user exchange
set up Github
