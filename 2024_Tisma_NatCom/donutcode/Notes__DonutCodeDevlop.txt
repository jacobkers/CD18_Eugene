Revisited donut code, working now from github version.
Moved old initval to data-out directories, cleaned all but 'versiontest'


23-4-19
-cleaning paths in setup : now I work with 'Data-in, 'data-out' and 'project'. Works on 'versiontest'
-copying core functions for sharing: spaghetti, cluster analysis; cleaning & commenting

30-1 sent to Github
-results are now written to project dir, not to data(for more regular backups)
-reorganized A050: cluster analysis: first analyze, then plot
-added quality check: '_A050_ClusterGeneralprops.mat' stores now number of clusters and total squared off-percentage

-corrected single-branch flipping

rebuttal run notes
1-case 6(main), 9(left-right) and 10(ori-right) re-run at 100 
	-all 3 single-branch 100 cells, with flipping
	:flipping seems not working well for left-right
	:ori-right very few cells left (10%) due to lack of donut
2: re run fullsets,single-branch,no flipping&flipping (6 runs)
	-found incorrect fliptype LR&OR; rerun
3: single branch does not allow flipping?
	-A20/C015(single-branch): bug in line 10 (wrong index); added demoplot
	note: the flipping procedure uses the global minimum. 	This works fine for the symetric cases (ori-ter and left-	right) but is somewhat less suitable for ori-right (where 	the small distance -angular, genomic- is more apropriate.
	-checked C010 (2branch). OK: This one just uses in which branch the minimum lies, no particualr index location of the minimum. 




17-1/22-1 sent to github:
Combined with full-stack save option in 'Crop code': 
added option in A010 'actions.workfullstackdiagnosis': JK_diagnosis_GetVerticalInfo. Collects 3D info per cell ; applied to dataset 106: '2016_11_23_2179_Wildtype_Zcheck'; data saved to: D:\jkerssemakers\_Recent\CD\BN_CD16_Sandro\Paper2018\Rebuttal 2\On 3D aspect; then option set off, code back to default.





16-1 works
A10 line 165 and elsewhere: keep chromosome stack, build function to asses vertical structure, later to evaluate


27-6 sent to Github
in A050: PeelblobsFromImage: enforced a post-peeling normalization sucht that all spot fractions add up to 1; later rejection steps may still lower this number.


27-6 sent to Github
A10: added saving of counts (cromosome, rfp, cfp) to basic cell geometries. Includes addition of tool: 	Processing_Fluorescence_SimplePatternAnalysis

13-4 sent to Github

		A10,A15 minor fixes
		A20 C25, C35 needed some repair on matrix handling
		testing for sandro 101-104; runs up to A050
		added suffix to Exp_overview excel file name


28-2 	sent to Github
	A020 continued, removed bug, genral props array now works
	A030 changing 'chromosome content' such that any property is processed, with saving changed per label 'whatspaghetti'
	A030 added 'LocalContent' , 'LocalWidth' and 'LocalPeakvalue'
works!
	


21-2 A020 edits to pass widths and possible other properties through alignment steps
	Aligned=EQUIANGLE_ORI_OrganizeBranchOrder: 
		-added GeneralPropertyArray: rows: content, FWHM, ridgelineradius,peakvalue
	Aligned=EQUIDIST_ResampleAlongRidge
		-made C025 compatible with both curve and array
		-added extra call C025 working a GeneralPropertyArray
	Aligned=EQUIBASEPAIR_ResampleAlongRidge(Aligned,initval);
		-made C035 compatible with both curve and array
		-added extra call C035 working a GeneralPropertyArray




13-2
Started  version (from A030) to plot 'width' spaghetti curves; still based on content 
width still needs to be passed trough all alignment steps (orig,dist, BP) in A20; now only content'is passed.
Consider expanding ''content'' to property arrays in C025, C035 ; might add an alignedmatrix to sequence
Consider keeping A30 and make it optional for any property; including naming of files; make content leading

23-1
worked on
A013_WF_PerCell_AnalyzeSpotsStandAlone (new)
A055_WF_2DClusterAnalysis_Standalone
...and subfunctions. A013 identiefies one or more spots per color channel


22-1-2018
Made a standalone 'A055' clusteranalysis (no need for prior donut analysis run)


8-1-2018
Started setting up 'A0001_WF_SettingsPerExperiment' to replace Excel import

Revisit ridge line work:
	A010: function Chromosome=ChromosomeRadialSampling_WideField(im,QI, sho);
	line 183: ldropofflengthIn=ceil(cc*dropofffractionIn); reoved factor two;  effect is that ridge line is much more 'pushed out
	tested on cell 20020, option 61 
Cluster analysis cosmetics: close contour lines
	A050_WF_2DClusterAnalysis; line 438 and lower; function GetClusterShapeProps line 530

A010: function Chromosome=ChromosomeRadialSampling_WideField(im,QI, sho);
line 103:  StetsonMask=BuildStetsonMask(cc,rr,0.1); changed this section such that masking is amplitude dependent so 
that gaps don't curl inward while still crossing clusters. Works okish


sent to github
18-12
Note: Alignment over ter gap suffers somewhat from the more meandering 'ridgeline' when we forced it to cross the clusters.
(see below, on 'StetsonMask=BuildStetsonMask(cc,rr,0.1)'. Put mask softening to 0.2 to see the result 
Therefore, 



2-branch alignment:
A20: added force-passing 'all cells' also to 2-branch alignment to make all frames pass for proxi-maps. 
	This is done in function C035, line 18: if ((CorFactor>1.5)|(CorFactor<0.6))&(~initval.PassAllCells);
However I noted that underlying reason reason for rejection of some image alignment is because of poor cfp spot tracking! Therefore checked: 
A10: spot tracking found to use  poorly masked images which offsets ter pos for example sim 100002_t05
Action: changed around 130:
 	Cfp_pic=Cfp_pic-median(Cfp_pic(:));    
    	Cfp_pic=Cfp_pic.*cellmask;
...and similar for Rfp



ridge line:
A010: masking sharper angles so that ridge line stays closer to max clusters
A010: function Chromosome=ChromosomeRadialSampling_WideField(im,QI, sho);
line 103:  StetsonMask=BuildStetsonMask(cc,rr,0.1); for demo %was 0.5 which is better for 
'smoother' loops when max crossing is not super relevant (such as for density curves)

handling:
A050: added 'demo'option' for doing single cell


sent to Github
15-12
A080: 
	added test options to show derivative distance maps
        replaced selection of density curve to correct one
	aligned sim contact maps now ok


sent to github

small changes to BuildNumericCellLabel to handle results from 'cropcode' on repli data 
works for both naming formats

27-11
Building alignment based on averaged label positions
-spit off 'get spotprops' from A010
added B010 to A020 : see if data  is movie, if so determine average RFP spot via averaged image
checked 'YFP leakage correct' option in 'Getspotprops
workflow ok  but to be adapted (avaraging gives strange label positions

note: spottracking A010 suboptimal




15-11
A050: 
	save Cluster properties per cell to result mat for later use
	extend these cluster properties
A085: load cluster props for 'domain maps' maps




sent to github
14-11
Updated Contact maps SIM:
-export non-tresholded tif files and plts in separate dirs
-resolved NaN-incomplete padding bug in distance curve back into A010
(was leading to incomplete contact maps): via new: 'Do_Periodic_Padding'



sent to github
24-10
A050: added option to measure psf instead of using set psf (B050)
Added column 'used psf' to A050 output
corrected: exclude zeros from calculating averages in table
B050: include amplitude criterion for slope-peak distance
some small patches


sent to github
17/18-10
Worked on radius (diameter) of clusters: see '20171018_On radius of gyration.doc'
extra save table with all cluster props in single columns
made 'A200' program for quick reading stuff



3-10
Expanded Annotations: 
Rewrite 'ManualGenerator' to output comments in hierarchical way ('A-B-C comments'); 
added annotations to 'A' programs; to be expanded.



sent to github

20-9 continued

-made settings: psf 2.7 instead of 2.9 for all; cluster analysis needed that (did bckground correction over-shrink blobs?) seems 2.5 would be better, to discuss
-A10: solved mask name issue 
(sim/widefield); now to be set in excel table; both  batchrun1 and 2 same format 
-running 6 and up one by one, A10-A50; adding column 'RawNo' to excel for estimate of analysis time
-running '6',BN2179main, as test, A10-A40 (skipping blobs). crash: ma_200046.mat is missing: incomplete unzipping? redid unzip; rerun


sent to github
20-9
-added new exp cases to initval; condensed lines
-full A10-A90 test run; ok A10-A50, 1300secs for ~90 cells
-added alignmodus to result dir name
-test run: A50 remove cluster spaghetti curve; repair code; works on 'test'
-added alignmodus, flipcells, passallcells to overview table
-reorganized data directories; 
	removed 'ori' subdir,location tables
	some debugging pathnames
-received & extracted fabai data, 15 sets



19-9
-no-content locations now get FWHM=NaN to exclude gaps from width measurements
-building relative time correlation:
A095_WF_SIMCorrelationDensity_Relativetime:
-every cell, every frame is correlated with any equal or later frame
-(30 cells, 20 frames take (30x20)^2 /2 =1.8*10^5 repeats! About a minute/cell, 30 mins.

-tried spaghetti 'spike' curves via 2D clusters; less intuitive we think.


3-9
some crashes while running content-based axes. replaced NaN by 0 for low content
re-adjusted pinindex in alignment -solved
now crash in A40; -solved
still weird graph panel 4 -solved
now alignment of marker is in BP plot is off again..-solved
cod eruns standard datasets now


28-8/29-8
added radius of gyration to basic properties; test on 'versiontest'
running new bg si data -had to solve interp bug 
solved cluster analysis bug (A050) crash when no cluster found
changed density curve : instead of PEAK values per radial section, 
go back to CONTENT per radial section since this gives larger range


23-8 send to github
batch run multiple exps	All progs; To quickly apply prog changes to data output [Fabai]

standardized data dirs names per exp, collect to one result dir
made export dir names specific per exp
Add 'bad alignment' handling	A20/A30 [Fabai]
add ter pos/val to output gap/peak analysis	[Fabai]

9-8
Excel:Clean up unused excel fields (saving type)
A015/A001/Excel: screen now for minimal angle of rfp-cfp 
A015,A30,A40: graph cosmetics: add exp name
A020/A30: flipmarkers added (at 90 degrees CW from ori,works for 1 and 2-branch
A030: Extra Panel Savings


8-8 sent to github
saving of summaryplots
A90 (sim) organized savings of correlation curves; 
added program names to output files('A040' etc)
tested on: versiontest,ori-right,old simdata,new simdata


7-8 continued
made ter-ori-angle criterion general; now based on minimal angle to be expected 
(to prepare for other strains). Test on ori-right, works

7-8 to Git
A90: works for 'Sim'
A40: works for 'test' and 'Sim'
A30 works for 'test' and 'Sim'
A20 works for 'test' and 'Sim'
added markerposses to kymograph, ok for 2-branch


2-8
Removed outer contour alignment options (B20 1 and 2,B25)

A20 re-organization since it was unclear
Moved B030 to A20 since it is only used there
split steps in: 
ORIG: shuffling of indices, branch order; get absolute and relative marker location
DIST: re-sample parameters along distance axis over ridge
	(use data from 'ori' fields)
BP: re-re-sample parameters along content over ridge
	(use data from 'dist' fields)

Marker properties are saved with:
orig: (original angle, index, distance (abs/%) from ori, BP perc% from ori
BP: BP perc% from ori, to double check correction





1-8
-A090: re-organized such that it will recognise frames belong to one cell

-A015: to account for sim and strain-specific screening settings, 
       move screen params to exp overview excel
