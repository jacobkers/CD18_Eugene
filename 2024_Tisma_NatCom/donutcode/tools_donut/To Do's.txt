	A040: added possibility to select range of minima or maxima strength



nov 15
	A40 extend axis histograms 
	A40 create ori (or ter) based local plot w/BP axis
	A30/A40 better names



nov 8
A030 added colored spaghetti curves Fig1B
A040 
	added CellOkay selection
	removed  inactive '1D peak peel section' around line 53
	link minima to genomic pos
	added extendedaxis to full-span scatterplots; for that refined F008, adapted A030 




nov 7/8

A015: CellOkaying: 
	Added 'screening summary' to A015
	get measure for ring intensity from pic
A020 and 
A030, to do 
		use cell okaying for follow-up tools-------ok, worked cellscreening in A020 and A030, to do A040
	
A030 then, work Fabai fig 2 graphs
	A030: add padding % on distance/BP density graph----ok
	A030: add 'ProduceFig1Aplot'   function (basic density curve plus padding)
	A030: add 'ProduceFig1Bplot' function ('spaghetticurves')

Others: 
a) A020/B020/25: added flipping to single branch function C015, verified flipping occurs in ~50%
b) re-activated contour analysis via distance along maxima of chromosome. 
	This works with proper pre-screening as in A015


issue: we do minima analysis based on distance axis,   but would like these to plot against genomic distance from ori and ter. 
How to proceed?
idea: re-build BP axis as in A080--> link every position to an BP axis value; then, add these to every max or min entry











oct 12
bundle width!!
write description
kymographs dynamics




sep 26
store bundle width
build local density axis based on annulii and circular crosssections
carefully check re-interpolation of this!

Per-curve tool:
spreading percentage around minima

prep code for movie analysis


sep 12
-make orientation flipping optional (default off)
-make two-point mapping to genomic/distance pos optional
-calculate per individual curve: genomic percentage, distance percentage
-final presentations: 	
	ori-ori ('less assumptions')
	ter-ter




april 25 on splitting branches
axis: measure outer contour length along angular axis (that sets order) via cartesian coordinates, 
starting point is contour point closest to  ori point
stopping point same with ter

then, align/stretch  thes contour length axes between ori and ter
(repro 6,3E)
finally, try axis swap based on local ter site content slope








april 5 fabai:
We talked today, the main plots will be the plots of the minimum distance of the cell wall to chromosome. Average + standard deviation. 
I’d still like to see kymographs of a chromosome stretched out and see how densities shift. Perhaps you can play around a little and see what looks good?

The rest, I’d like to think it over the talk to you again on Monday.

done 29-3
adjusted loading by labels new dataset;
removed various bugs
skipped drift

some instabilities in yfp analysis remain...


march 21 Meeting Cees, Nika, Fabai, Xuan, Me

-improve contour max line!
-pad gaps w/ NaN
-time average
-align with ori
-parameters: length along maximum
-density bp/rad
