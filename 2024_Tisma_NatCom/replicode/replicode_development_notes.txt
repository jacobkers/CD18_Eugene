-all runs except 28 work up to A60 (28: cell count difference issue) 
-A62: 23 run issue (masks and ori pics don't match size --> 
-solved: cells and masks repli/A60 were not matching

28-3-2022
-reviving runs, made some data search tries (doesn't work well)
-ok: run 24.1: MukB paper (O:\CD_Data_out\2016_Sandro\2018_SJ\MukB-MatP paper\MukB raw data\BN2820-Wildtype\)


2-3-21 Refresh run notes MukBef:
Setup
-start Fortisclient, 
-start webdrive, map 'bulk' (X) and Groups (V)
-open A062, open Init, case 24 (local) and 24.1 (remote)
-data is saved to hardwired local repli path
-run it via 'lazyshell'
-case 24 (local) works
-case 24.1 works



TO DO--- nov 2020------------------------------------------------
-	First , get MukB signal around ori profile :
-	get profile ,get radius& average %
-	Then we mask out the ori-related intensity and look at the rest:
	 Raman found a twice higher than average intensity for DNA of MukB overlapping with DNA : '' MukBef compacts DNA ''
	Now, check this non-ori related MukB signal: is it symmetric or not	
•	Run via X en L: use Fortisclient and Webdrive

18-11 githubbed
----------------------
aim: We should use com of the chromosome or preferable donut export export: passing  donuts, donut center
data is here:(these paths are reachable using Fortisclient and Webdrive
donut output: X:\tnw\BN\CD\Shared\Raman van Wee L\BatchanalysisResults



issue: current paths in the code are strongly generalized, but now we need donut output paths too. Plus, we have the overrides, very different locations of donut- and repli data etc. 
approach: We should have clear and full source paths, also for future reference. We have only a few basic paths we need: 
	crop
	donut
	repli
	excel(for the overview table, since there may be more)
done: rewrote config file for hardwiring paths









DONE---------------------------------------------------------------
18-11-20 githubbed
-commenting code in 'ManualMaker' format for documentation purposes, before new changes
-synching code in github
-transfering active coding dir to Drobbox/github; renamed repository




12-10-2020/13-10
A62 (new)
	load pairs of images (specifically, chromosome and MukB),
	build image coordinates [XX, YY]
	load spot info (specifically, chromosome_COM [cx,cy] and ori
	measure angle ori-com, then rotate image coords to XX', YY'
	measure percentages positive and negative X' to evaluate symmetry
	save the result as excel, manual fine-tuning by user to pick good donuts
other
to do: change config such that I can load from here:

6/7-10-2020
set up new testdata index '24': MukB-testdata-2019.02.04 BN2820+A22+DAPI002

to do/done:
issue: X020 absent, then channel order set at 4 (repli-init, line 70)
solved: added override in 
Config settings: if number and order of fields are specified, they are not loaded

A60
	done: added optional field initval.tresholdperchannel=[NaN 0.2 0.5 0.5 0.6];
	MDs tresholding seems interesting too
	done: save tresholded images
		in: Localize_2Channels, optional save (for MukB&chro)

21/22-5 sent to github
Aim: Channel rename recognition; 5th channel handling
Approach: After changing channel naming in crop code, plus 5th-channel option:
Testdata: 'Raman1':

Step-by-Step:
Setup
-A00__LazyShell: put  A005 behind others, it is not needed for non-movies
-testdata runs ok
-allow for channel swap: 
		% OLD               NEW
    		% cellc1: cfp-ter   ph/bf
    		% cellc2: yfp-chro  same
    		% cellc3: rfp-ori   same
    		% cellc4: ph/bf     cfp-ter
    		% cellc5: extra     ..._mukbef (optional)
		Thus,  c1 and c4 are effectively swapped!
		note:	pathinfo.newchannelnaming is saved in X020: celldata.mat

		A000_Repli_Init: 
			1) set epath 1 level higher
			2) made function channelorder=Check_channel_order(initval,epth);
			3) flag initval.channelorder (1 or 2)
		A013  
			Work_spotimage_CfpTer: adapted for channel order 
18-4 
1) In Replicode; A13: correct replicode position data w/cell com
	Work_spotimage_RfpOri and Work_spotimage_CfpTer: added Add_XY_Rel2CellCenter to storage

Work on: data:

10-10 'Re-analysis of 34 SIM cells' Donut code, sent to Github
aim: re-run SIM data for FWHM width
setting up:
1) data sim analysis: 
	data transferred to 'Sandro dir': 
	2017-09-19 FW simcellcrop3_bgsub_crop_ma1BnF 
	2017-09-19 FW simcellcrop3_fullmask
	(SIM movies, re-cropped by FW)
2) added to table 'Overview_testruns_donutdata.xlsx':
	simcellcrop3_fullmask	   
	simcellcrop3_bgsub_crop_ma
3) in table: set psf to 2,9 (that is WF pixels!); set pix2nm at 32,5 (full pixels is 65!) ; set  no flipping, single branch
4) in Donutdata code: initval=A000__WF_Get_JacobPathsandExperiments(batchrunindex): add case 201, 202
5) run A000_WF__ClickAndGo: full run up to A050 run check: case 201 ok, case 202 misses 'mask' files

Cehecks: table A010_Cell_BasicGeometries
columns
	chrom_averageFWHM	(column N)
	chrom_stdFWHM	(O)
	chrom_maxFWHM	(P)
	chrom_minFWHM     (Q)
these are collected via: ThisCellBasicGeometry=Get_And_Save_BasicCellGeometry:
%Cromosome FWHM
    Chro_W_av = nanmean(Chromosome.PolarContourFWHM);
    Chro_W_st = nanstd(Chromosome.PolarContourFWHM);
    Chro_W_mx = nanmax(Chromosome.PolarContourFWHM);
    Chro_W_mn = nanmin(Chromosome.PolarContourFWHM);
function:
-Chromosome=ChromosomeRadialSampling_WideField
	-Chromosome=Get_ChromosomeEdges(Chromosome,QI);
	Here Polar contours are found, these are corrected for 	the oversampling that is used the radial pattern.
			-Get_ProfileFeatures: 
			Here, one radial profile through the chromosome pattern is analyzed. 	
All values are in pixel units of the fluorescent image (thus, half the regular pixel size for WF)
The cell wall is measured from the 'mask' as obtained from the crop code; this mask has the same sized pixels as the fluorescent (SIM) data
All polar contour data excludes 'gap' sections. Gap sections are set as follows: a radial map of the chromosome is made. 
This map is masked to suppress intensity at low and hight raddii, thus emphasizing the 'main ridge'.
The standard deviation of this map is taken per angle; profiles with a very shallow std (0.02*the 4*std average) are seen as gaps. 
Angles associated with these gaps are NOT included in further contour measurements (width, average, max of the contour).

FWHM is what is says, the FWHM of a radial profile, in image pixels

for this SIM data: Average value for all cells (N=34), all time points (11 frames) is 9,4077477378x32,5=306 nm. 
Per Cell: see excel: simcellcrop3_fullmask_A010_Cell_BasicGeometries_with average per cell
